## Fachpraktikum / Practical Course

**Logic App Development**  
PD Dr. Manfred Kufleitner

---

### Course Overview

You will build your own logic quiz application using Flutter/Dart and Go. Students will work on their own. The course consists of two parts:

1. **Introduction**: Formal logic, Flutter/Dart, and Go. Several small exercises will be provided, and successful completion of these tasks is a requirement for the second part.
2. **Main Course**: Specification, implementation, and documentation of a mobile application. This part represents 100% of the total assessment of the course.

---

### Application Requirements

Users of the app should answer multiple choice questions and track their progress. The questions should be about equivalent logical formulae. Participants need to implement three components:

1. **User Interface**: A mobile application in Flutter/Dart (50%).
2. **Server Side**: For providing the quiz questions and user management, written in Go (30%).
3. **Automatic Generation of Quiz Questions**: Written in either Dart or Go (20%).

---

### Passing Criteria

- Achieve at least 40% of the total marks.
- The first component must be fully functional.
  - Instead of implementing the third component, you can write a minimum of 10 quiz questions yourself and opt out of implementing the server side (you will not receive marks for these components if opted out).

**Note**: You do not need to address encryption and security issues regarding the server side for this course.

### Assessment Components

1. **Specification of the App**:

   - In PDF format (no more than three pages).
   - Brief description of all three components.
   - Create mock screens for all user-facing screens (hand-drawn sketches are OK).
   - Submit at the beginning of the second part of the course.

2. **Implementation Repository**:

   - A single git repository for all three components.
   - Provide full access to this repository for marking purposes.

3. **Documentation Report**:

   - In PDF format, documenting the studentâ€™s work and actions taken to ensure high quality (e.g., unit testing, user research, etc.).
   - Includes a short user guide for each component.

4. **Presentation**:
   - A short presentation of the coursework (in English or German).
   - Date agreed upon in the second half of the course.
   - Participants are invited to attend the presentations of their peers.

### Recommendations

While basic facts on formal logic and Boolean algebra will be refreshed, it is recommended that participants have some prior knowledge (e.g., from attending the course Theoretische Informatik II). Prior experience in Flutter/Dart and Go is not necessary.
